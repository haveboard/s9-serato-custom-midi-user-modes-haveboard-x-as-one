# haveboard X As-One S9 Midi Mapping
### URL: https://github.com/haveboard/s9-serato-custom-midi-user-modes-haveboard-x-as-one
A hybrid of my original S9 mapping [ https://github.com/haveboard/s9-serato-custom-midi-user-modes-1 ] combined with a mapping I helped DJ As-One compile which he used in his 2018 Goldie Awards Submission  DJAS1 | 2018 GOLDIE AWARDS | Submission [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cofLZM99xkc ] along with additional features such as a transport mode, and special functions for the parameters for each mode including mute (also called silent cue)(um3), instant doubles(um2, um4), load next (um2), 1/4 loop roll (um2,um3), sample bank sections (um1)
