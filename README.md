# haveboard X As-One S9 Midi Mapping
### URL: https://github.com/haveboard/s9-serato-custom-midi-user-modes-haveboard-x-as-one
A hybrid of my original S9 mapping [ https://github.com/haveboard/s9-serato-custom-midi-user-modes-1 ] combined with a mapping I helped DJ As-One compile which he used in his 2018 Goldie Awards Submission  DJAS1 | 2018 GOLDIE AWARDS | Submission [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cofLZM99xkc ] along with additional features such as a transport mode, and special functions for the parameters for each mode including mute (also called silent cue)(um3), instant doubles(um2, um4), load next (um2), 1/4 loop roll (um2,um3), sample bank sections (um1)

## Instructions

**Volume faders** both also _control the master volume of the Sample Banks_

Set your Channel Faders to the tightest curve that way the volume only cuts out when the channel faders are already down, giving you better control over the master volume of the sample bank.
This can be a little weird to get use to at first but it works great once you get comfortable.

The **Mic Hi EQ** will _control the right deck pitch_ when in internal mode and the **Mic EQ Low** will _control the pitch of the left deck_.
